      <txt><![CDATA[DATANUM identifies the particular sample from which the case is drawn in a given year. For most censuses, the IPUMS has multiple datasets available which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).

The 1970 samples present a special case; in addition to geographic coding differences, the samples were drawn from two distinct questionnaires ("long forms"), referred to in the IPUMS as Form 1 and Form 2. Different questions were asked of the persons in the Form 1 and Form 2 samples, necessitating separate treatment in the record layout. For other census years, DATANUM has a value of 1 because only one sample is available for that year.

The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs." [URL omitted from DDI.]]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.

Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also PERWT for a corresponding variable at the person level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 1% and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
HHWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a HHWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. HHWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household when using HHWT.

      <labl>Group quarters status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.

Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[MOMLOC is a constructed variable that indicates whether the person's mother lived in the same household and, if so, gives the person number of the mother (PERNUM). The method by which probable child-mother links are identified is described in MOMRULE for samples from 1970 to present and in MOMRULE_HIST for samples prior to 1970.

MOMLOC makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of children and their (probable) mothers. 

In 2017, the family interrelationship variables for samples from 1970 to present were revised to increase comparability across IPUMS projects and include same-sex couples. Many researchers who are familiar with the previous version of family interrelationship variables will find it useful to read a brief overview of the key differences of the  New IPUMS Family Interrelationship Variables [URL omitted from DDI.]. On this page you'll find information on how family interrelationship variables are constructed, common uses of these variables, and specific examples of how these variables can be used efficiently.

Samples prior to 1970 continue to use the original version of family interrelationship variables.

User Caution: MOMLOC identifies social relationships (such as stepmother and adoptive mother) as well as biological relationships. For 1970 and later, MOMLOC will also identify the unmarried partner of a child's father identified with POPLOC 

If the person identified with MOMLOC has a spouse or partner identified through SPLOC, the spouse or partner will also be identified as a parent through POPLOC (if a different-sex couple) or MOMLOC2 (if a same-sex couple). POPRULE  and MOM2RULE  will communicate the method through which those relationships are identified.

The relationship codes are divided into two categories: relatives (codes 1-10) and non-relatives (codes 11-13). In general, the codes for relatives are self-explanatory.

      <txt><![CDATA[With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in the IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded.

IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACESING, and should consult the race code relationship page, Relationship between RACE and RACESING codes [URL omitted from DDI.], for detail about how the RACE and RACESING codes are related.

In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. Users primarily interested in historical comparability should consider using RACESING and/or the accompanying variables PROBAI, PROBAPI, PROBBLK, PROBOTH, and PROBWHT.  Note that Hispanic origin is assessed through separate questioning (see HISPAN).

Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.

User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.]]></txt>

Origin is defined by the Census Bureau as ancestry, lineage, heritage, nationality group, or country of birth. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race; see RACE for a discussion of coding issues involved.

      <txt><![CDATA[GRADEATT reports the grade or level of recent schooling for people who attended "regular school or college" at the time of interview (1960-1980) in the past two months (2000) or three months (ACS/PRCS).  GRADEATT is only asked of those people who responded "yes" in SCHOOL. However, information from HIGRADE has been used to construct it for the 1960-1980 period as well.  For a summary of educational attainment, see EDUC (available from 1940 onward) or HIGRADE (available in fewer samples than EDUC, but gives full detail on grade attendance and completion).

"Regular school or college" includes only nursery school or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, and schooling that leads to a high school diploma or a college/graduate degree. The Census Bureau considers tutoring and correspondence courses to be "regular school" if credit can be received in a "regular school." The Bureau does not consider "vocational, technical, or business school" to be "regular school." However, a detailed definition of "regular school or college" was not provided on the form.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[GRADEATT reports the grade or level of recent schooling for people who attended "regular school or college" at the time of interview (1960-1980) in the past two months (2000) or three months (ACS/PRCS).  GRADEATT is only asked of those people who responded "yes" in SCHOOL. However, information from HIGRADE has been used to construct it for the 1960-1980 period as well.  For a summary of educational attainment, see EDUC (available from 1940 onward) or HIGRADE (available in fewer samples than EDUC, but gives full detail on grade attendance and completion).

"Regular school or college" includes only nursery school or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, and schooling that leads to a high school diploma or a college/graduate degree. The Census Bureau considers tutoring and correspondence courses to be "regular school" if credit can be received in a "regular school." The Bureau does not consider "vocational, technical, or business school" to be "regular school." However, a detailed definition of "regular school or college" was not provided on the form.]]></txt>

      <labl>Occupation</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[Universe Note: "New Workers" are persons seeking employment for the first time, who had not yet secured their first job.

OCC reports the person's primary occupation, coded into a contemporary census classification scheme (some non-occupational activities are also recorded in the pre-1940 samples). Generally, the primary occupation is the one from which the person earns the most money; if respondents were not sure about this, they were to report the one at which they spent the most time. Unemployed persons were to give their most recent occupation. For persons listing more than one occupation, the samples use the first one listed.

Note Regarding Multi-Year Samples: In Multi-Year ACS files, OCC codes depend on the original year the respondent was interviewed (see MULTYEAR). For example in the 2011-2015 5-year ACS sample, respondents from 2011 correspond to the set of OCC codes used from 2010-2011, while respondents from 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 correspond to the set of OCC codes used from 2012-2015 (see ACS/PRCS Occupation Codes [URL omitted from DDI.])]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
OCC is a 4-digit variable reporting the person's primary occupation, coded into a contemporary census classification scheme (some non-occupational activities are also recorded in the pre-1950 samples). Generally, the primary occupation is the one from which the person earns the most money; if respondents were not sure about this, they were to report the one at which they spent the most time. Unemployed persons were to give their most recent occupation. For persons listing more than one occupation, the samples use the first one listed. OCC specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

      <labl>Weeks worked last year, intervalled</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[WKSWORK2, like WKSWORK1, reports the number of weeks that the respondent worked for profit, pay, or as an unpaid family worker during the previous year. For the census, the reference period is the previous calendar year; for the ACS, the reference period is the previous 12 months. WKSWORK2 differs from WKSWORK1 in that responses are given in intervals (1-13 weeks, 14-26 weeks, and so on), instead of the precise number of weeks. This is because the 1960 and 1970 samples recorded weeks worked only in intervals. For the other years contained in WKSWORK2 (the 1940-1950 and 1980-2000 censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS), the exact number of weeks worked is recorded in WKSWORK1. 

For further discussion, see the WKSWORK1 variable description. See EMPSTAT for definitions of key labor force and employment terminology.]]></txt>

Users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. Consumer Price Index adjustment factors for the appropriate years can be found in the CPI99 variable.

The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note [URL omitted from DDI.] for further details.

      <txt><![CDATA[POVERTY treats respondents who live in families collectively. It expresses each family's total income for the previous year as a percentage of the poverty thresholds established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently revised in 1980, adjusted for inflation (see the poverty definition page [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information). POVERTY assigns all members of each family - not each household - the same code. POVERTY is also calculated for most adults living as unrelated individuals. For the 1950-2000 censuses, the reference period for income is the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period is the preceding 12 months from the date of interview.

Whether an individual falls below the official "poverty line" depends not only on total family income, but also on the size of the family, the number of people in the family who are children, and the age of the householder (under/over age 65). POVERTY was created using detailed income and family structure information about each individual and calculating the family income as a percentage of the appropriate official poverty threshold. For example, if a person's family income is $20,000 and the poverty threshold for such a person is $13,861, then the value of POVERTY for that individual is $20,000/$13,861 * 100 percent, or 144. Individuals whose family income is more than five times the appropriate poverty threshold receive a POVERTY value of 501. For more detail on the precise poverty thresholds used for the POVERTY variable, see the poverty definition page [URL omitted from DDI.].

In POVERTY, the IPUMS evaluates poverty status individually for each distinct family unit in the household, as defined in FAMUNIT. For example, all persons related to the household head receive the same poverty value as the head, while an unrelated person and her child would share their own value distinct from that of the primary family. As mentioned in the FAMUNIT variable description, it is possible for individuals identified as being non-relatives of the head (RELATE) to be included in the primary family (FAMUNIT 1), based on family pointer information [URL omitted from DDI.]. However, because the POVERTY values for primary families in the 2000 Decennial and ACS/PRCS samples are published in the PUMS by the Census Bureau (see User Caution below) and the Census Bureau strictly excludes "non-relatives" (RELATED &gt; 1100) from primary families, some individuals identified as FAMUNIT 1 by IPUMS USA will not have the same POVERTY value as the head of household. These individuals will instead have the single-person poverty calculation assigned to them by the Census Bureau.

The original PUMS samples for years prior to 1990 did not include a poverty variable. Original PUMS samples from 1990 onward included poverty values, but IPUMS poverty values differ from the original PUMS values in a key way. The original PUMS samples treated all households members unrelated to the head as one-person families when assigning poverty values, even if such persons were part of a secondary family (i.e., persons living with their own relatives but not related to the household head). Thus, the original PUMS poverty measures do not account for the presence of children (or any other aspect of family size and composition) in secondary families. For example, in the original 1990 PUMS sample, a woman unrelated to the householder who has a child would receive a poverty value appropriate for a single person with a given income, rather than for a two-person family with a child. Consequently, the original PUMS samples from 1990 onwards tend to underestimate poverty. In the IPUMS, by contrast, the POVERTY value would be based on the threshold fitting the secondary family consisting of both the mother and the child. The IPUMS samples also round to the nearest poverty value, while the original census PUMS samples always round up.

User Caution: The incomes of the highest-earning individuals are "top-coded" in the 2000 census data, the ACS and the PRCS samples (see 2000 income Top codes [URL omitted from DDI.]). In the 2000-present period, for individuals in the first family unit of every household (cases where FAMUNIT=1), POVERTY uses the poverty values in the original PUMS samples, which are based on respondents' pre-top-coded income information. The POVERTY value for some of these cases will differ from calculations one could make by hand using the available information in the top-coded income variables. As noted above, the IPUMS calculates POVERTY values for members of secondary families, and these values are based on top-coded income information. (Like the ACS, the IPUMS also uses the income adjustment factor before calculating poverty, although use of this factor is not recommended with IPUMS data. See the ACS income standardization note [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information.) This variable also includes some valid values for group quarters (GQ) residents, even though the stated universe does not include such cases. Users who want to maintain a consistent universe should manually exclude group quarters residents.]]></txt>

POVERTY is a 3-digit numeric code expressing each family's total income for the previous year as a percentage of the poverty thresholds established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently revised in 1980, adjusted for inflation (See Poverty Definition Page [URL omitted from DDI.]). POVERTY specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below by Census year (and data sample if specified).

In 1980, responses to questions about workplace location were coded for only half the persons in the IPUMS. These cases yield representative proportional distributions but not correct absolute numbers for the general population.

Users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. Consumer Price Index adjustment factors for the appropriate years can be found in the CPI99 variable.

The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note [URL omitted from DDI.] for further details.
